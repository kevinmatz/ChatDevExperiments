Please create a text adventure game, where the player can move between locations using commands such as N, W, E, and S to move north, west, east, and south to other locations. The game should be set in the city of Amsterdam, and should have at least 30 locations that the player can visit, such as the Rijksmuseum, Rembrandthuis, and other tourist attractions. Each location should have a short description that is displayed when the player is in that location. Please distribute some appropriate objects to locations in the game. Players can GET and DROP these objects. For example, in the Rembrandthuis, the player could pick up a paintbrush.
